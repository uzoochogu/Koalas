| Read from file to memory           | Creates a copy of the file in memory for fast operations. This should be limited to small CSVs or may not be considered|
| Stream from file / Random Access   | Can query specific cells within the csv file                                                                           |

## Installation
This Library can be built and used as either a shared library or a static library.
### Requirements
- Cmake 3.10+
- C++ Compiler that support C++17 and above

### Windows
1. clone repositary
```powershell
git clone https://github.com/uzoochogu/Ursidae
```
2. Navigate to repositary download directory
3. Run cMake to configure build system, with the following flag.
```powershell
cmake .
```
4. **(Shared)** For Shared library build run
```powershell
cmake --build -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS:BOOL=ON
```
4. **(Static)** For Static library run
```powershell
cmake --build -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS:BOOL=OFF
```
5. **(Shared)** Copy generated `dll` file and `.lib` file to you project folder and add additonal dependencies in your project. (Guide coming soon).


5. **(Static)** Copy generated `.lib` file into you Project folder and add dependency.

#### Adding Dependency
From the project properties page 
```
Project->Properties->Linker->Input->Additional Dependencies  -> add the .lib file here 
Project ->Properties->Configuration Properties->Linker->General ->Additional Library Directories  -> add the  corresponding .lib directory here .
```
or
```
From the solution explorer . Right click the project name ->Add->Existing Itemâ€¦ and select  the right .lib file.
```

### macOS
(WIP)
### Linux (Ubuntu)

## Simple User Tutorial
This library supports both object oriented programming paradigm and functional paradigm. For larger projects, the Object oriented usage will allow for better organization, efficiency and memory management. You might consider the Functional usage for quick protyping and smaller projects.
<p>In an Object oriented approach, DataTables are used.</p>

### Creating a DataTable:
There are multiple ways to create a DataTable. 
1. **Passing Comma Separated values**
```c++
DataTable ursa{"Name,Sex,Age,Weight,Akpos John,Male,27,70Kg,Eze Kelechi,Not Disclosing,23,60kg", True};
```
This creates a Table like:

2. **Initialize with a csv file**      
```c++
DataTable ursa(std::string filepath);              
```
3. **Initialize with a vector of vector of strings**
```c++
std::vector<std::vector<strings>> data = {{"Name",      "Sex",           "Age","Weight(Kg)"},
					  {"Akpos John","Male",          "27", "70"  },
					  {"EzeKelechi","Not Disclosing","23", "60"  }};
```

        
4. **Specify the datatype data**
```c++        
std::vector<std::vector<strings>> data = {{"Name",      "Sex",           "Age","Weight(Kg)"},
					  {"Akpos John","Male",          "27", "70"  },
					  {"EzeKelechi","Not Disclosing","23", "60"  }};
DataTable ursa(data, {"std::string", "std::string", "std::string", "unsigned int" });
```
5. Maps - Experimental


### Reading from a CSV File
#### OOP Approach
```c++
DataTable ursa;
ursa.read_csv("test.csv", utf8);  //Stores it in memory more efficiently.
```

#### Functional Approach
```c++
std::vector<std::vector<std::string>> ursa = Ursidae::read_csv("test.csv", utf8)     //if you want to manipulate it yourself but less efficient.
```

### Streaming  from file / Random Access 
You can query specific cells within the csv file.
```c++
std::vector<double> cash = ursa.at(-1,col);            //-1 indicates the whole rows the at() method can also be used to
//or
std::vector<double> cash = ursa[-1][col];              //same implementation as at()
```

#### Using functional approach
```c++
std::vector<double> cash = Ursidae::read_csv("test.csv", utf8)[-1][col];
```


### Write to File
Writes to a csv file, you can create, overwrite or append.
```c++
ursa.to_csv("test.csv");
Ursidae::to_csv("test.csv");     //functional approach
```

### Editing Cells
```c++
ursa.put("Akpos", 1, 2);      //Overwrites row 1, column 2 cell with data; 
//or
ursa[1][2] = "Akpos";         //Random Access and Write
```



## Notes
1. More functionality is being added.
2. A proper documentation would be published later when there are more features.
