## Installation
This Library can be built and used as either a shared library or a static library.
### Requirements
- Cmake 3.10+
- C++ Compiler that support C++17 and above

### Windows
1. clone repositary
```powershell
git clone https://github.com/uzoochogu/Ursidae
```
2. Navigate to repositary download directory
3. Run cMake to configure build system.
```powershell
cmake .
```
##### Build the project
4. **(Shared)** For Shared library build run
```powershell
cmake --build -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS:BOOL=ON
```
4. **(Static)** For Static library run
```powershell
cmake --build -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS:BOOL=OFF
```
5. **(Shared)** Copy generated `dll` file and `.lib` file to you project folder and add additonal dependencies in your project. (Guide coming soon).


5. **(Static)** Copy generated `.lib` file into you Project folder and add dependency.

#### Adding Dependency
From the project properties page 
```
Project->Properties->Linker->Input->Additional Dependencies  -> add the .lib file here 
Project ->Properties->Configuration Properties->Linker->General ->Additional Library Directories  -> add the  corresponding .lib directory here .
```
or
```
From the solution explorer . Right click the project name ->Add->Existing Itemâ€¦ and select  the right .lib file.
```

### macOS
(WIP)
### Linux (Ubuntu)

## Simple User Tutorial
This library supports both object oriented programming paradigm and functional paradigm. For larger projects, the Object oriented usage will allow for better organization, efficiency and memory management. You might consider the Functional usage for quick protyping and smaller projects.
<p>In an Object oriented approach, DataTables are used.</p>

### Creating a DataTable:
There are multiple ways to create a DataTable. 
1. **Passing a list of Comma Separated values**
```c++
DataTable ursa{"Name,Sex,Age,Weight(kg)","Akpos John,Male,27,70", "Eze Kelechi,Not Disclosing,23,60"};
```
This creates a Table like:
| |Name 	| Sex            | Age | Weight(Kg) |
|-| ---------   | -------        | --- | ----       |
|0|Akpos John   | Male           | 27  | 70         |
|1|Eze Kelechi  | Not Disclosing | 23  | 60         |

2. **Initialize with a csv file**      
```c++
DataTable ursa(std::string filepath, true);              
```
3. **Initialize with a vector of vector of strings**
```c++
std::vector<std::vector<strings>> data = {{"Name",       "Sex",           "Age","Weight(Kg)"},
					  {"Akpos John", "Male",          "27", "70"  },
					  {"Eze Kelechi","Not Disclosing","23", "60"  
DataTable ursa(data);
```

        
4. **Specify the datatype of the data**: All methods of initializing support this.
```c++        
std::vector<std::vector<strings>> data = {{"Name",       "Sex",           "Age","Weight(Kg)"},
					  {"Akpos John", "Male",          "27", "70"  },
					  {"Eze Kelechi","Not Disclosing","23", "60"  }};
DataTable ursa(data, {"std::string", "std::string", "std::string", "unsigned int", "double" });
```
5. Maps - Experimental


### Reading from a CSV File
#### OOP Approach
```c++
DataTable ursa;
ursa.read_csv("test.csv", "utf8");  //Stores it in memory more efficiently.
```

#### Functional Approach
```c++
std::vector<std::vector<std::string>> ursa = Ursidae::read_csv("test.csv", "utf8")     //if you want to manipulate it yourself but less efficient.
```

### Streaming  from file / Random Access 
You can query specific cells within the csv file.
```c++
int age = std::static_cast <int>(ursa.at(-1,2));          //returns string, converted to 23
//or
int age = std::static_cast <int>(ursa[-1][2]);            //same implementation as at()
```

#### Using functional approach
```c++
int age = std::static_cast <int>( Ursidae::read_csv("test.csv", "utf8")[-1][2]);     //23
```


### Write to File
Writes to a csv file, you can create, overwrite or append.
```c++
ursa.to_csv("test.csv");	       //overwrites or creates file
Ursidae::to_csv("test.csv", data);     //functional approach
```

### Editing Cells
```c++
ursa.put("Akpos", 1, 2);      //Overwrites row 1, column 2 cell with data; 
//or
ursa[1][2] = "Akpos";         //Random Access and Write
```



## Notes
1. More functionality is being added.
2. A proper documentation would be published later when there are more features.
